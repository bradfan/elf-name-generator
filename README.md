This fun Christmas project is in basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Most of what is rendered to to the page is done dynamically through JavaScript and the CSS was tricky at times to ensure mobile responsiveness. This is still in development and I have forwarded the link to friends and family to get some feedback. I hope you have fun with it!! Be sure to check out my GitHub profile for my contact info!
